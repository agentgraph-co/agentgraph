"""AI-writing-tell detector for marketing bot drafts.

Catches the tells from Wikipedia's "Signs of AI writing" + Pangram + the
Barron's "it's not just X, it's Y" research:
  - Overused vocabulary (delve, tapestry, crucial, pivotal, ...)
  - Negative parallelism: "not just X, but Y" / "not X, but Y"
  - Copula avoidance: "serves as", "stands as", "represents", ...
  - Em-dash density (when combined with other tells)
  - Missing punchy short sentences (no human variability)
  - Empty closer hedges: "in conclusion", "ultimately", ...
  - Empty opener hedges: "in today's ever-evolving world", ...

Usage:
    result = check(draft_text, platform="bluesky", strict=True)
    if not result.passed:
        # retry with hint, or reject
        ...
