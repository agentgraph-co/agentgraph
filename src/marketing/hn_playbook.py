"""Canonical Hacker News "Show HN" playbook.

Single source of truth for the HN submission contract. A Show HN gets flagged
fast if you paste promo copy as the post body, so the correct shape is:
  title (<=80 chars) + URL in the url field + EMPTY body + a substantive first
  comment posted immediately.

The admin draft-review (web/.../MarketingTab.tsx -> HNContract) renders exactly
these four fields. Keep the prose here in sync with docs/internal/hn-launch-package.md.
