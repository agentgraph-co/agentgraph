"""Cross-implementation regression test for APS rotation-attestation fixtures.

Binds ``src.signing.canonicalize_jcs_strict`` to the APS rotation-attestation
fixture set at ``https://aeoess.com/fixtures/rotation-attestation/``.

**Why this test exists.** CTEF v0.3.1 §6.3 declares the continuity-layer
composition rule as "rotation-attestation chain, content-addressed" and
co-normatively cites aeoess's rotation-attestation spec. The composition
only works if AgentGraph and APS produce byte-identical canonical output
for every fixture in the published set. A silent drift — on null handling,
unicode escaping, key ordering — breaks every rotation-attested receipt in
the wild without any visible API change.

**Why live-endpoint fetch, not a repo snapshot.** Per commitment on
A2A#1672 (issuecomment-4314555571): this test pulls canonical bytes from
``aeoess.com/fixtures/rotation-attestation/`` at test-collection time and
pins SHA-256 in code, rather than committing a repo-local snapshot. That
way the fixture version is always what APS is actually publishing — if
APS revs the set and our canonicalizer drifts, the test fails loudly; if
our pinned hash drifts from APS's published hash, same.

If this test fails, do not patch ``canonicalize_jcs_strict`` to match:
a silent canonical change invalidates every previously-signed CTEF
envelope that composed an APS rotation-attested continuity claim. Treat
the failure as a breaking interop event, coordinate with aeoess.

Sibling to ``tests/test_jcs_canonicalize_aps_interop.py`` (bilateral
delegation, snapshot-based) and ``tests/test_cte_test_vectors.py``
(self-published CTEF vectors). Together these three tests close the
canonicalization loop across APS bilateral delegation, APS continuity
rotation, and our own CTEF envelope/verdict shapes.
