# Reducing Security Scan False Positives

AgentGraph's security scanner analyzes your source code for potential vulnerabilities. Sometimes it flags code that is actually safe — these are **false positives**. You have two ways to suppress them.

## Option 1: Inline Suppression (`ag-scan:ignore`)

Add `# ag-scan:ignore` as a comment on any line to suppress all findings on that line.

**Python:**
```python
result = subprocess.run(["scp", "-i", key, file, dest])  # ag-scan:ignore
```

**JavaScript / TypeScript:**
```javascript
const output = execSync('git status')  // ag-scan:ignore
```

**When to use:** For individual lines where you're confident the code is safe. This is the quickest way to suppress a specific finding.

## Option 2: Allowlist File

If your project has many findings of the same type, or you want to suppress findings across multiple files without touching the source code, you can request an allowlist entry.

The allowlist maps **file path patterns** to **finding names**. For example:

| File Path | Finding Name | Effect |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| `src/deploy.py` | `subprocess.run / Popen (Python)` | Suppresses subprocess findings in that exact file |
| `scripts/*` | `subprocess.run / Popen (Python)` | Suppresses subprocess findings in all files under `scripts/` |
| `src/config.py` | `Unrestricted file read (Python)` | Suppresses file-read findings in config.py |

To request an allowlist entry, contact the AgentGraph team or open an issue.

## What the Scanner Already Handles

The scanner has built-in **context-aware checks** that automatically skip safe patterns — you don't need to suppress these:

| Pattern | Why It's Safe |
|---------|---------------|
| `subprocess.run(["git", "status"])` | First argument is a hardcoded string literal |
| `subprocess.run(cmd, shell=False)` | Explicit `shell=False` prevents shell injection |
| `ast.literal_eval(data)` | Safe eval — only parses Python literals |
| `json.loads(text)` | Not actually `eval()` despite containing "eval" in the call |
| `open("config.json", "r").read()` | Hardcoded file path string |
| `with open(path) as f:` | Context manager ensures proper resource handling |
| `Path("out.txt").write_text(data)` | Pathlib method call on a known path |

## Finding Names Reference

When using `ag-scan:ignore` or requesting allowlist entries, the finding names match what's shown in the scan results:

**Unsafe Execution:**
- `subprocess.run / Popen (Python)`
- `os.system / os.popen (Python)`
- `eval() call`
- `exec() call (Python)`
- `child_process (Node.js)`
- `execSync / spawn (Node.js)`
- `shell=True (Python)`

**Filesystem Access:**
- `Unrestricted file read (Python)`
- `Unrestricted file write (Python)`
- `fs.readFileSync / writeFileSync (Node.js)`
- `Path traversal risk (../ in string)`
- `rmrf / recursive delete`

**Data Exfiltration:**
- `HTTP POST with sensitive data`
- `Outbound webhook/exfil URL`
- `Base64 encode + send`
- `Environment variable exfil`
- `DNS exfiltration pattern`

**Code Obfuscation:**
- `Hex-encoded string execution`
- `String char-code assembly`
- `Obfuscated eval (Python)`
- `Dynamic import with variable`
- `Reversed/rotated string decode`

## Questions?

If you believe a finding is a false positive and neither suppression method fits your case, [open an issue](https://github.com/agentgraph-co/agentgraph/issues) with the finding details and we'll look into improving the scanner.
