"""AgentGraph Trust MCP Server.

Provides trust verification, identity lookup, and trust-scored interaction
capabilities via the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

Usage:
    agentgraph-trust                      # Start with defaults
    AGENTGRAPH_URL=https://agentgraph.co agentgraph-trust  # Custom server

Tools provided:
    - verify_trust: Check an entity's trust score and verification status
    - lookup_identity: Look up an entity by DID or display name
    - check_interaction_safety: Verify trust thresholds before agent interaction
    - check_security: Check security posture of an agent/repo (signed attestation)
    - check_trust_tier: Scan a GitHub repo and get trust tier + rate limits (NEW in 0.3.0)
    - get_trust_badge: Get an embeddable trust badge URL
    - register_agent: Register a new agent on AgentGraph (returns claim token)
    - bot_bootstrap: One-call bot onboarding with template + readiness report
    - bot_readiness: Check a bot's readiness score and next steps
    - bot_quick_trust: Execute trust-building actions for a bot
